# Sprint 08 Supervised Learning 
 
**Objective:** Develop a machine learning model for Beta Bank that uses data of customers' demographics and behaviors to predict whether or not a customer is likely to leave the bank soon (since retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones).

**Skills Demonstrated:** Data preprocessing, data encoding, class imbalance handling, machine learning model hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation
