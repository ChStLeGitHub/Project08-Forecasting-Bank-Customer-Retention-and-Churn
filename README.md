# Project 08: Supervised Learning 
 
**Objective:** To develop a machine learning model for Beta Bank that uses data of customers' demographics and behaviors to predict whether or not a customer is likely to leave the bank soon (since retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones).

**Accomplishment:** To pass this project, the model must have an F1 score of at least 0.59. After using upsampling (and hyperparameter tuning), my random forest classifier model had an F1 score of 0.627 on the test set. (Additionally, the precision and recall values were very similar, 0.624 and 0.630 respectively, suggesting a good balance between the two.)

**Skills Demonstrated:** Class imbalance handling (upsampling vs downsampling), data encoding, and model evaluation
